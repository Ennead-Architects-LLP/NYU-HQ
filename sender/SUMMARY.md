# Update Summary: Multi-File Sender with Smart HTML Handling

## ✅ What Was Changed

### Core Functionality
The sender now handles multiple file types with smart HTML naming:

1. **Latest HTML → `index.html`**: The most recent HTML file (by modification time) is renamed to `index.html`
2. **Supporting files keep names**: CSS, JS, JSON files are uploaded with their original filenames
3. **Batch processing**: All files uploaded in a single run

### Modified Files

#### 1. `send_report.py` - Main Script
**Key Changes:**
- `find_report_files()` - Now returns `(latest_html, supporting_files)` tuple
- `update_github_file()` - Added `target_name` parameter for renaming
- `update_all_files()` - Handles HTML separately from supporting files
- `main()` - Updated to show file categorization

#### 2. `README.md` - Documentation
Updated to reflect multi-file support

#### 3. `CHANGELOG.md` - Version History
Added v2.0 with detailed migration guide

#### 4. `MULTI_FILE_GUIDE.md` - Developer Guide
Complete guide for using the multi-file system

#### 5. `FILE_HANDLING.md` - Quick Reference
Simple reference for file handling rules

## 🎯 Behavior

### Before (v1.x)
```
reports/latest.html  →  docs/index.html
```

### After (v2.0)
```
reports/
  ├── report_2025_10_20.html  →  docs/index.html (renamed)
  ├── styles.css              →  docs/styles.css (preserved)
  ├── script.js               →  docs/script.js (preserved)
  └── data.json               →  docs/data.json (preserved)
```

## 🔧 For Report Generators (Other Repo)

### What You Need to Do

Generate files in the reports folder with these names:

```python
reports_folder = Path("C:/Users/.../reports")

# Generate HTML with ANY filename - it becomes index.html
with open(reports_folder / "report_2025_10_20.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(generate_html())

# Generate supporting files - use EXACT names that HTML references
with open(reports_folder / "styles.css", "w") as f:
    f.write(generate_css())

with open(reports_folder / "script.js", "w") as f:
    f.write(generate_javascript())

with open(reports_folder / "data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(report_data, f)
```

### HTML Must Reference Files Correctly

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Test
```bash
cd sender
python send_report.py
```

### To Deploy
```bash
cd sender
build.bat
```

This creates `NYU_HQ.exe` with the new multi-file functionality.

## ✨ Benefits

### 1. Solves Chrome Security Warning
- Splits large HTML into smaller files
- More professional website structure
- Less suspicious to security scanners

### 2. Better Performance
- Browser can cache CSS/JS separately
- Only re-download changed files
- Faster repeat visits

### 3. Easier Maintenance
- Edit CSS without touching HTML
- Update data without redeploying code
- Clean separation of concerns

### 4. Flexibility
- HTML filename doesn't matter
- Supporting files use standard names
- Works with any number of files

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**

If you only have a single HTML file (no CSS/JS/JSON), the sender works exactly like before:
```
reports/report.html  →  docs/index.html
```

## 📝 Testing Checklist

Before deploying the new version:

- [ ] Test with single HTML file only
- [ ] Test with HTML + CSS
- [ ] Test with HTML + CSS + JS
- [ ] Test with HTML + CSS + JS + JSON
- [ ] Test with multiple HTML files (verify latest is chosen)
- [ ] Verify files load correctly on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Check browser console for 404 errors
- [ ] Verify CSS styling applies
- [ ] Verify JavaScript runs
- [ ] Verify data loads from JSON
